## Models
- **EfficientNetB0**: Known for its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks, this model has been adapted to focus specifically on ocular images.
- **ResNet101**: Leveraged for its deep residual learning framework, making it ideal for handling complex image recognition tasks associated with eye pathologies.

## Dataset
The models are trained on a curated dataset named ODIR-5K comprising various eye images, annotated with details regarding multiple ocular pathologies. This dataset includes a wide range of conditions to ensure robust model training and performance evaluation.

## Installation
To get started with Caladan, clone the repository as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toufiqmusah/CALADAN.git
cd CALADAN
